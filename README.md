Code of SPDFusion: A semantic prior knowledge-driven method for infrared and visible image fusion

## Tips:<br>
Due to file size issues, the training set has been removed from the code and the MSRS dataset can be downloaded here: https://github.com/Linfeng-Tang/MSRS
Place the downloaded training dataset under: MSRS/Visible/train path and MSRS/Infrared/train path.

## To Train
Run "**--isTrain=1 python main.py**" to train your model.
The training data are selected from the MSRS dataset. 

## To Test
Run "**--isTrain=0 python main.py**" to test the model.
The images generated by the test will be placed under the Fusion/MSRS path.
